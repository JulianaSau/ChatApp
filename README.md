> ## Technologies

<p align="justify">
*Note: This project was setup and developed on a system running Windows 10. The stacks used for the project include:
</p>

| <b><u>Stack</u></b>          | <b><u>Usage</u></b>   |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **`Javascript`**             | Programming language. |
| **`Node JS`**                | Environment           |
| **`React JS`**               | Frontend              |
| **`MongoDB`**                | External Database     |
| **`Express JS`**             | APIs.                 |

#

<!-- > ## Repo Setup

<p align="justify">
To setup the repo, first fork the Zurichat YouTube Music, then clone the forked repository to create a copy on the local machine.
</p>

    $ git clone git@github.com:pauline-banye/music_video.git

<p align="justify">
Change directory to the cloned repo and set the original Zurichat repository as the "upstream" and your forked repository as the "origin" using gitbash.
</p>

    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:zurichat/zc_plugin_youtube_music_video.git

#

> ## Setting up the project

<p align="justify">
The first step requires the download and installation of Python 3.9 and a check to confirm that pip and the necessary dependencies are properly installed.
</p>

<p align="justify">
After the installation of the Python program, setup the project environment with pip and virtualenv in the command prompt, powershell or gitbash terminal. Virtualenv helps to create an isolated Python environment containing all the packages necessary for the project.
</p>

\*Note:

- This project was setup using the gitbash terminal. Some of the commands used do not work with command prompt or powershell.

* If a "pip command not found error" is encountered, download get-pip.py and run `phython get-pip.py` to install it.

###

    $ pip install virtualenv

Navigate to the cloned local project folder. Create a virtual environment folder and activate the environment by running the following commands in the gitbash terminal.

###

    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/scripts/activate

<p align="justify">
Once the virtual environment is active, the next step is the Django installation. Django is an open source Python web application framework thats helps with the rapid development of secure websites.
</p>

###

    $ (venv) pip install django

<p align="justify">
After installing Django, install Django REST framework in the gitbash terminal. The Django REST framework is a flexible toolkit for building Web based APIs. The REST framework was used for the creation of APIs, serialization and the authentication process for this project.
</p>

###

    $ (venv) pip install djangorestframework

Install all the necessary dependencies for the project. A few of them are listed below.

| <b><u>Modules</u></b>     | <b><u>Usage</u></b>           |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| **`django-cors-headers`** | Cross Origin Resource Sharing |
| **`gunicorn`**            | WSGI HTTP server              |
| **`whitenoise`**          | Static files                  |
| **`Markdown`**            | Markup language               |
| **`django-environ`**      | Environment configuration     |

An exhaustive list can be found in the requirements.txt file included in this project. The modules can be 'batch installed' using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

### Frontend

- #### Build the client

      $ cd server/client (frontend folder)
      $ yarn
      $ yarn build

- #### Build the single-spa root

      $ cd root
      $ yarn
      $ yarn build

- #### Start the client

      $ cd server/client (frontend folder)
      $ yarn
      $ yarn start

- #### Start the single-spa root

      $ cd root
      $ yarn
      $ yarn start

      - Frontend devs: You don't need to start django server. Only start the client and single-spa root to view your edits.

- #### Lint the Frontend

      $ cd server/client (frontend folder)

      $ yarn lint --fix (or yarn lint --fix . to fix all files)

- #### Running Tests and generating test coverage report

      $ cd server/client (frontend folder)

      $ yarn test

      - To view coverage report : inside test-coverage/icov-report there's an
      index.html file, open this file in a browser to view coverage report.

#

### Backend

- #### Run the Django Server

      $ cd server (Backend folder)

      - Create .env file in config and specify variables for Secret Key and system environment using the sample.env file

      $ python manage.py runserver

- #### Pre-commit and lint the Backend

      $ cd server (Backend folder)

      $ pre-commit run (or pre-commit run --all-files to check all files)

      - Backend devs: You don't need to run yarn start to test your endpoints.

- #### Running Tests

      $ cd server (Backend folder)

      $ python manage.py test music/tests

#

### Note to the DevOps

- Build first before starting django server
